// 1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
// 2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
// 3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console, 
// using the following syntax:
// if(myVariable){
//               //action
// }
// 4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether 
// the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the 
// console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an 
// ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement 
// insteadâ€”experiment!
// 5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.

// Answer:
// 1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
let myVariable = true;

// 2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
console.log("The value of myVariable is: " + myVariable);

// 3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console.

    console.log("myVariable is true.");

if (!myVariable) {
    console.log("myVariable is not true.");
} else {
    console.log("myVariable is true when using '!' operator.");

// 1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age

// 4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to 
// confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
// 5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to 
// confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol
// 6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if

//As discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with JavaScript, the JavaScript function Math.
// random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0 
// but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and 
// using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to 
// generate a random number between 0 and 9:
// // random number between 0 and 1
// let randomNumber = Math.random(); 
// // multiply by 10 to obtain a number between 0 and 10
// randomNumber = randomNumber * 10; 
// // removes digits past decimal place to provide a whole number
// RandomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber); 
// In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
// 1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value 
// is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You 
// can increase this number as you add more results.
// 2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can 
// repeat back in the final output.
// 3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different 
// value from the random number generator. 
// 4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence 
// printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case, 
// assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
// 5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case 
// response, to the console after the user enters their question.                                           
// Answer:
// 1. Get a random value between 0 and 5.
let randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6); // Generates a random number from 0 to 5.

// 2. Create a prompt to get a string value input from the user.

// 3. Create 6 responses using a switch statement based on the random number.
